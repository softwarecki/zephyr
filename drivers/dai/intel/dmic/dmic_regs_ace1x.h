/* DMIC Sync Period
 *
 * ESYNCPRD&SYNCPRD indicates the number of master link clock the sync event should be generated
 * periodically. 0-based value. Minimum sync period should never be programmed to less than 125 Hz.
 * The sync event is 1 master link clock wide per sync period.
 * Value must be programmed before setting SYNCPU bit. Default value of zero (sync period = 1 clock)
 * means the sync event will be asserted every clock, i.e. the sync period counter is disabled.
 * When value is programmed to a non-zero value from a current zero value and set SYNCPU bit, HW
 * enables the sync period counter to operate.
 * E.g. for 19.2 MHz XTAL oscillator clock, 4 KHz sync period, the value to be programmed is 12BFh.
 * Value may be programmed dynamically when sync period counter already running, and request an
 * update by setting the SYNCPU bit. */

/* Command Sync
 *
 * This bit is used to synchronize the command execution of multiple link segments. Software sets

 * have been setup with the same command, and lastly write to the SYNCGO bit to simultaneously clear
 * this bit on all link segments.
 * Note that the SYNCGO bit may be located in this register (same link type) or located in CLTSYNC
 * register (cross link type) depending on parameter TTSCLTSE. */

 * the CMDSYNC bit on all link segments. */
